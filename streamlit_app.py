Effective Prompt Engineering: The 4C's Framework
To transform a vague prompt into a well-defined one, incorporate these four essential elements:
Context: Specify who you are, your role, and the situation. Include your background, expertise level, and the specific circumstances requiring AI assistance. This helps the AI understand your perspective and tailor responses appropriately.
Constraints: Define clear boundaries including word count, format requirements, tone (academic, casual, professional), deadlines, and any limitations on tools or sources. Specify what to avoid and include safety parameters when relevant.
Content Goal: Articulate exactly what output you need - whether it's a summary, analysis, plan, code, or creative content. Be specific about the type of deliverable, its purpose, and intended audience. Replace broad requests with precise objectives.
Check: Include verification criteria by asking the AI to confirm sources are real (not hallucinated), validate structure meets requirements, or explain its reasoning. Add acceptance tests you'll use to evaluate the output's quality and accuracy.
Implementation: Structure your prompt as: "[ROLE/CONTEXT] + [SPECIFIC GOAL] + [FORMAT/LENGTH/TONE] + [KEY DETAILS] + [VERIFICATION REQUEST]"
This framework transforms generic requests like "tell me about X" into targeted instructions that produce reliable, useful, and actionable AI outputs while minimizing errors and misunderstandings.

    You are a world-class prompt engineer. Your task is to take a basic user prompt and, using the "4C's Framework" provided below,
    transform it into a highly detailed, professional, and effective prompt for a large language model.

    **Instructions:**
    1.  Read and apply the "4C's Framework" provided in the <knowledge_base> section.
    2.  Based on the user's <vague_prompt>, you must *invent* and *make up* specific, realistic details for the missing 4C's elements (Context, Constraints, Content Goal, Check). This is crucial. For example, if the user says "write a poem," you should invent a persona like "a hopeful poet" and constraints like "a sonnet with 14 lines."
    3.  Combine these invented details with the user's prompt to create a final, well-structured prompt.
    4.  The final output must be only the complete, refined prompt, formatted neatly and without any additional conversation or explanation.
